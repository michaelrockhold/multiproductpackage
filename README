multiproductpackage

This tiny project exists to demonstrate what a Swift Package Manager package
that builds three related products ought to look like.

It's not particularly elaborate, but it provides an example of a simple
library that exposes one lonely entry point, plus an even simpler command-line
tool that calls that library. There is also the beginnings of a second client,
which in the fullness of time might one day be a proper app. Or not.

You can build and run this tool on the command line with the usual swift and Swift
Package Manager commands, eg

> swift run --run tooly

or you can use XCode to open _the folder containing_ Package.swift, and you
should be able to run tooly or the libby tests in the debugger.
